[find it here!](https://super-cool-blog-thing.herokuapp.com/)

note: it's not actually a blog. i just kept calling it one while i was making it, so it's like an inside joke with myself.
i'm hilarious.

### Description

Super cool forum where users can read each other's posts and interact via commenting. Super cool.

### Tech used
- Ruby
- Rails
- PostgreSQL
- HTML
- CSS

### Features
- User authentication allows for separation of users and their entries. Users can also update their profiles on the site.
- Persistance of data! Even when you log out, your posts are still there!
- But careful, users that aren't logged in can view entries and all posts are displayed on the homepage! 
- If logged in, a user can make a new post directory from the homepage or their dashboard (accessible by clicking on their name)
- Commenting! Users can comment on each other's posts. Users can only delete their comments and nobody else's. Yes, even if you're
  the author of the entry.
  

### Future Implementations
- Threaded comments!
- Direct messaging between users! Take that interactivity to the next step.
- More robust user profiles. Avatars/pictures and the like. Actually have their name instead of an email. Stuff like that.
